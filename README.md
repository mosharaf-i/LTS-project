# LTS Project 
#### [McGill University, Northeastern University, City of Montreal]
 **Hello everyone, thanks for checking my GitHub!**  
 In this folder, you can see some of the codes I wrote for different section of the LTS project!  
 
 (Please note that I'm back to update and improve this folder, so it's a job **in process:D**)
  

‚û°Ô∏è Files and documents in this folder tend to showcase my experience and skills with GIS and coding tasks, as well as thought process to understand, and implement methods to tackle the questions during the project.


üìã During this project we used LTS method developed by Prof. Peter Furth (Northeastern University) and implemented it on the road and cycling network of Montreal. However, along the project, other analysis were also added, such as: intersection LTS, accessibility to the bike lanes, and comfort level analysis.

 ‚úèÔ∏è Most of the data was provided by the City of Montreal, however, since more data was needed for calculating and analysing , other sources were identified and gathered as well.  
 For instance, we manually gathered bike lanes' width by measuring google maps satellite images.
 Also, we contacted and used an insurance company's data for analysing all segments' speed data.
